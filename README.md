# Road_accident_Dashboard.
I have created this interactive Road accident Dashboard using #Excel.
a road accident dashboard to provide a visual representation and analysis of road accident data. It aims to provide insights into accident trends, patterns, and risk factors, ultimately assisting in making informed decisions regarding road safety and accident prevention. The dashboard typically displays key metrics such as the number of accidents, locations, types of vehicles involved, severity of injuries, and contributing factors. It helps stakeholders, such as government agencies, law enforcement, and transportation authorities, monitor and evaluate road safety initiatives, identify high-risk areas, and develop targeted interventions to reduce accidents and improve overall road safety.
Approach:
1. Requirement gathering from client
2. Identify the Stakeholders of the Project
3. Data cleaning as per the requirement
4. Data Processing by adding some customized columns in data
5. Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions
6. Data Visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights
7. Report/ Dashboard creation from start to end
